<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is the relay server for CrewLink, an Among Us proximity voice chat program. I am currently hosting a server at `https://crewl.ink/`, but if you want a more reliable option I would suggest to deploy this repository yourself.

## Environment Variables

Optional environment variables:

 - `PORT`: Specifies the port that the server runs on. Defaults to `443` if `HTTPS` is enabled, and `9736` if not.
 - `ADDRESS` **(REQUIRED)**: Specifies the server domain
 - `NAME`: Specifies the server name
 - `HTTPS`: Enables https. You must place `privkey.pem` and `fullchain.pem` in your CWD.
 - `SSLPATH`: Specifies an alternate path to SSL certificates.

## Deploy to Heroku

To get up and running quickly, you can deploy to Heroku using the button below

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

This will deploy an instance of the crewlink-server. You can get the URL of your server by using the app name that you gave when you launched the app on heroku and appending `.herokuapp.com`. You can also find the URL of your server by going to "Settings", scrolling down to "Domains", and removing the `https://` and trailing slash from the url. Using this URL, follow step 4 of the [installation instructions](https://github.com/ottomated/CrewLink-server#manual-installation) to connect your client to your server instance.

## Docker Quickstart

Run the server with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) by running the following command:

```
docker run -d -p 9736:9736 ottomated/crewlink-server:latest
```

To change the external port the server uses, change the *first* instance of the port. For example, to use port 8123:

```
docker run -d -p 8123:9736 ottomated/crewlink-server:latest
```

### Building the Docker Image

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ottomated/crewlink-server.git

```

2. Run the Docker build command:
```sh
docker build -t ottomated/crewlink-server:build .
```
